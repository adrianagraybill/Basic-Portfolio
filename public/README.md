Feature #1: Add functionality

Why are we implementing this feature?
As a user, I want to view a unique portfolio so that the developerâ€™s projects and skills stand out.
What are we going to implement?
Given that a user opens the application in the browser
When the user navigates to the home page
Then the portfolio contents should be displayed

How are we implementing it?
Complete the following features:
Use CDNs for content from libraries and remove the source code files from the project, as applicable
Note: CDNs are available for all libraries except Breakpoints.JS
In tablet view, show a fixed navigation menu instead of a hamburger menu
Convert the large image at the top of your portfolio to a video background or an image carousel containing at least three images

Add any other UI features that you feel will make your portfolio unique and personalized
